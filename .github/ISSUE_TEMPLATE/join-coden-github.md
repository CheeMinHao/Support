# Request to Join Coden GitHub Community Organisation.
---

<!-- Required Details -->

#### Name:

Chee Min Hao

#### Discord Username:

Min Hao#8174

#### Why do you hope to be one of us?
> To further develop myself as a developer/programmer

> Found Coden from The Hacker Collective's Advertisement

> A rather small scale community compared to the already huge ones (e.g. zeromaster.io, The Hacker Colective) which
feels more like being part of a community

> To gain more network and insights, and to hopefully be able to share mine in the future as well :D
